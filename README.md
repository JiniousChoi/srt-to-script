# srt-to-script
For learning English as a non native speaker, watching video is one good way to learn it. Better yet, reading script of that video loudly and come back to the video again! srt-to-script takes an subtitle format of srt and outputs script-like text file. Screenplay look-and-feel and print-friendly is the key. So that you can print it, read it repeatedly, learn it, nail it and master the dialogue from the video. Then you become a better English speaker. :)
