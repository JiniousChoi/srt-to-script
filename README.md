# srt-to-script
For learning English as a non native speaker, watching video is a one good way to learn it. Better yet, reading script of that video loudly and come back to the video again! srt-to-script takes an subtitle format of srt and outputs script-like text file. Screenplay look-and-feel and print-friendly is the key. So that you can print it, hold it, read it over and over, learn it, master dialogue from the video, and finally become a better English speaking person. :)
